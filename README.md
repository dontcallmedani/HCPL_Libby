# HCPL_Libby


Introduction
  I enjoy reading in my spare time and I use my local library to check out ebooks. 

Project Goals
  My goals were to analyze borrowing trends per year, month, and hour to see if there were any trends. My intial hypotheses were that I would have a borrowing peak in January and that I was more likley to borrow books during the late night/early morning time window.

Data Sources
  The Libby app has a smart tag that automatically tracks all borrowed books on your account. I exported this data as a csv file and cleaned the data to better serve the time based reporting that I wanted to run.

Key Findings
  The data confirmed that I am more likley to borrow books between 09:00 pm - 07:00 am which aligns with my hypothesis. I was surprised to see that October was the month with the most borrowed books. When filtered by year, October 2021 had 42 borrowed books which causes the spike. When years 2022 - 2025 are selected, the data more closely aligns with my average borrowing.

Technologies Used
  Microsoft Excel, Tableau
  
Limitations
  Data from Libby was limited, I would have liked to have more information regarding genres or category tags.
